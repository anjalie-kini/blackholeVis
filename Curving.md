# Curving

## "Distances" Determine Geometry
An event is a nail driven into space time. The distance between any pair of events is the spacetime interval. The Distances between points in space becomes a table of intervals. The table of distances allows us to describe and reproduce the spacetime geometry of a surface -- plane or curved.

## Reference Frames are Secondary
Curvature exists with or without reference frames. Spacetime can even be described without a reference frame. We may choose to use several difference reference frames to describe events. Different reference frames offer different "vantage points" to study spacetime.

In four-dimensional spacetime, travelers detect the deviation from parallelism of nearby worldlines of free particles, each of which follows an ideally straight spacetime path, often called a geodesic.

## Free Float Frame
General relativity predicts that nothing, not even light, can escape from a black hole if the emitting satellite gets closer to the blackhole than the event horizon.

A spacecraft floating towards a blackhole could observe it until eventually plunged in -- this is called a free float frame.

However as we approach the black hole the dimensions of our frame must be progressively constricted if we are to verify that it is free float. Near the center of a black hole, relative accelerations become nearly fatal (consider a free floating person -- as they get closer to the blackhole, different parts of the body will experience different gravitational accelerations. The feet will be accelerated faster than the head which is further away -- this is called spaghettification!).

Tidal gravitational accelerations compress the astrophysicist on all sides as they stretch him from head to feet. He is crushed in width and radially extended in length.

One limitation of a free float frame near a black hole is the tidal acceleration experience by test particles as the frame falls toward zero radius.

No single free float frame is large enough to describe relations between two events that occur on opposite sides of the central mass.

## The r-coordinate: reduced circumference
The closer the distribution of mass to exact spherical symmetry, the better the spacetime geometry around such a structure confirms to the wonderfully simple solution to the general relativity equations (Schwarzschild)

1. Take the center of attraction to be a black hole
2. Let it have the same mass as the sun
3. Build around it an open spherical shell of rods fitted together in a mesh of triangles - an alternative to our latticework of rods and clocks in local free-float frames
4. Mount clocks on this shell. The rods and clocks of this shell provide one system of space-time coordinates in local events
5. We want to measure the size of this spherical shell - imagine we run a tape measure around it (circumference) and divide it by 2 pi to obtain a distance that would be the directly measured radius of the sphere if the space inside it were flat. This radius is termed the coordinate radius or r-coordinate.

Directly measured separation between nested shells is greater than the difference in r-value. We can - in principle - conduct a more sensitive test of the nonflatness of space much closer to the centers of these objects while staying external to them.

## Gravitational Redshift
Time also enters into the (space-time) curvature around a blackhole. In no way is "Time curvature" more apparent than in the behavior of a signal emitted from a clock bolted to a spherical shell near a gravitational body. Let this clock tick by emitting light in a radially outward direction. The emitted light increases its period of vibration as it climbs up out of the gravitational field.

The period of the received light increases more and more as the emitter stands closer and closer to the black holes.
Details of this increased period imply curvature not only of space but of time - curvature of spacetime!

Visible light with the longest period is red. The remote observer sees light emitted by the close-on clock to be "redder" (of longer period) than it was at the point of emission. This is called gravitational red shift. The gravitational red shift allows us to give a meaning to the phrase "cannot escape".

Light of any period emitted from near the event horizon suffers a gravitational redshift to a long period, the closer the clock is to the horizon, the farther to toward infinity the period glows as the light climbs out of the black hole to a greater distance.

Gravitational red shift occurs between two clocks that are at different radii and both at rest with respect to the black hole or other center of gravitational attraction. Another and different red shift occurs due to the Doppler effect when two clocks move away from one another.

For observers on the Earth this recessional red shift is in principle partly canceled by the gravitational blue shift of the light as it drops into the gravitational well surrounding Earth.

## Mass in Units of length
Universal gravitation constant G characterizes the gravitational interaction between bodies.

## Metrics for Flat Spacetime
Events and intervals form a universal language that connect flat spacetime geometry and Schwarzschild geometry. Let f,x, and y mark the separation between two events on a spatial plane when this separation is timelike. Then

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\tau^2 = t^2 - x^2 - y^2" /> (Timelike space time interval)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\rho^2 = -t^2 + x^2 + y^2" /> (Spacelike space time interval)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;(d\tau)^2 = (dt)^2 - (dr)^2 - (r\cdot d\phi)^2" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;(spatial\ separation)^2 = (dr)^2 + (r \cdot d\phi)^2" />

## The Schwarzschild Metric for Curved spacetime
The metric for the proper time between two timelike events in a plane on flat spacetime is given by

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;{d\tau}^2 = dt^2 - dr^2 -r^2{d\phi}^2" />

**Schwarzschild metric:** For two events close to one another the Schwarzschild metric introduces us to curved empty spacetime in a spatial plane through the center of spherically symmetric (non spinning) center of gravitational attraction

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;{d\tau}^2 = (1 - \frac{2M}{r}) dt^2 - \frac{dr^2}{(1-\frac{2M}{r})} - r^2{d\phi}^2" /> [timelike form]

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;{d\rho}^2 = (1 - \frac{2M}{r}) dt^2 - \frac{dr^2}{(1-\frac{2M}{r})} - r^2{d\phi}^2" /> [spacelike form]

The Schwarzschild metric gives a complete description of spacetime external to a spherically symmetric, non-spinning, uncharged massive black hole. Every (nonquantum) feature of spacetime around this kind of blackhole is described or implied by the Schwarzschild metric.

At the radius 2M something strange happens to the Schwarzschild metric. The time term goes to zero and the radial term increases without limit as r approaches the value 2M in both timelike and spacelike versions. This special value of the radial coordinate is called the Schwarzschild radius.

Reasons it makes sense:
1. Depends only on r-coordinates
2. Goes to flat space time metric for larger M
3. Goes to flat spacetime metric for zero M
4. Confirms dr is less than the directly measured distance between shells
5. Confirms gravitational redshifted

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;d\tau = dt_{shell} =1-(\frac{2M}{r})^{\frac{1}{2}} dt" /> [clock at rest on shell]

The Schwarzschild metric applied only outside the surface of an object but a test particle can explore all of spacetime around a blackhole without bumping into the surface since there is no surface at all.

## Picturing the Space Part of Schwarzschild geometry
In general relativity, every coordinate system is partial and limited, representing one or another feature of curved spacetime and misrepresenting other features.

If you freeze time (set dt = 0) and limit yourself to a spatial plane passing through the center of the black hole then the spacelike form of the Schwarzschild metric becomes

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;{d\theta}^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{2M}{2}} + r^2d\phi" />

Some figures embed curved space geometry on the flat Euclidean three space geometry perspective -- they are called embedding diagrams.

## Far Away Time
The Schwarzschild metric uses what we call far away time t. There can be many remote clocks recording far away time t. These remote clocks for a latticework that extends in all directions from the isolated black hole. Far from the influence of the black hole, these clocks are in a region of flat spacetime, so they can be synchronized with one another using light flashes.

We call the time far-away time as read on these clocks at rest with respect to the attracting body ephemeris time or t-coordinate.

By definition, the time lapse between two events is that recorded on a remote clock by an observer far from the attracting mass. Two events that occur at the same place evidently have a timelike relation, so choose the timelike version of the Schwarzschild metric.
