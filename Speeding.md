# Introduction to Speeding

## Special relativity describes the very fast.

General relativity (the Theory of Gravitation) describes matter and motion near massive objects (stars, galaxies, blackholes, etc.) and the universe as a whole.

## Wristwatch time
First we need to understand wristwatch time. Imagine a wristwatch attached to a stone which is thrown. The stone follows Newton's First Law. There are two points at which the wristwatch ticks. We measure the distance (s) and time (t) between these two ticks in a particular free-float or inertial reference frame.

NOTE: special relativity warns us that a different observer passing us in uniform relative motion typically records a different value of spacial separation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;s" title="Distance" />) and time lapse (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t" title="Time" />) between ticks.

All inertial observers, regardless of their state of relative motion and values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;s" title="Distance" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t" title="Time" /> agree on the value of time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\tau" title="Wristwatch Time" /> between ticks as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;{\tau}^{2} = t^{2} - s^{2}" title="The Metric" />

The metric tells us the separation between events in spacetime.

We call <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\tau" title="Wristwatch Time" /> the wristwatch time and it can be used to describe the separation between any pair of events for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t" title="Time" /> is greater than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;s" title="Distance" />.

For simplicity, the units of space and time are the same (i.e. light years and years). The speed of light (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;c" title="Speed of Light" />) is the conversion factor between measures of space and time. Wristwatch time (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\tau" title="Wristwatch Time" />) is an invariant, because it is constant for all observers.

Speed depends on the reference frame, in this case <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;v =\frac{s}{t}" title="Velocity" /> (units cancel out) so velocity is a fraction of the speed of light (unitless).

## Proper distance
If two events occur simultaneously, we cannot use wristwatch time. Simultaneous events are therefore useless for measuring time but perfect for measuring length.

To find a rod's length we can set off explosions at each end at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t = 0" title="Time" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;s" title="Distance" /> would be our distance. BUT special relativity warns us that a different observer passing in uniform relative motion typically would not agree that both explosions occurred at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t=0" title="ime" />. However, all initial observers agree in the distance: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;R^2 = s^2 - t^2" title="Common Distance" />.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;R" title="Proper Distance" /> is called the proper distance and it describes the separation between  any pair of events for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;s" title="Distance" /> is greater than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t" title="Time" />. Again, units of space and time are the same. The proper length is therefore the length of a rod as measured in a rest frame.

## The Principles of Extreme Aging
Flat Spacetime is the arena of the free float frame in which special relativity correctly describes motion.

The Twin Paradox predicts the motion of a free particle. If one twin stays on earth and the other travels to a distant star and returns, when they are reunited they will no longer be identical. We call being at rest "natural" -- the motion of the traveling twin is forced, not natural. BUT viewed from a second relatively moving free-float frame, the twin on earth moves with constant speed in a straight line which is also natural motion. In any such frame the time lapse on the wristwatch of the earth twin can be calculated from the metric.

The natural motion of a free object between two events in flat spacetime is the one for which the wristwatch worn by the object has an extremal (maximum or minimum) time reading between those two events.

PRINCIPLE OF EXTREMAL AGING: The path of a free object takes between two events in spacetime is the path for which the time lapse between these events, recorded in the object's wristwatch is an extremum. This works for general relativity too!
