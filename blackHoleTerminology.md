## Some Terminology

** Kerr Black Hole:** a spinning black hole -- the most common form in nature because it rotates from the star is was created from

** Schwarzschild Black Hole:** a non-spinning black hole -- the most simple black hole

** No-Hair Conjecture:** after formation, once stable, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum

** Event Horizon:** boundary in space time through which matter and light can only pass inwards towards the mass of the black hole

** Singularity:** the center of a black hole at which spacetime curvature is infinite

** Gravitational Lensing:** the gravity of a foreground cluster or galaxies distorts the images of background galaxies into arc shapes

** Gravitational Time Dilation:** object appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon, taking infinite time to reach it

** Gravitational Redshift:** light appears redder and dimmer

** Ergosphere:** area of distorted space around the event horizon caused by the spin of a black hole

** Static Limit:** boundary between normal space and the ergosphere
