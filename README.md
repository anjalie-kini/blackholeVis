# Basics of a Black Hole

## What is a Black Hole?

"A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying." -- [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html)

## How Big is a Black Hole?

Black holes can come in varying sizes. It is believed that black holes can be as small as an atom, but with huge masses. There are also "stellar" blackholes which have masses up to about 20 times that of the sun. It is believed that there may be many stellar black holes in the Milky Way Galaxy. The largest black holes are "supermassive" black holes which have masses over 1 million times that of the sun. Scientists have proven that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of every large galaxy. At the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A.

## How Are Black Holes Formed?

It is believed that the smallest black holes were formed at the beginning of the universe. Stellar black holes are formed when the center of a massive star collapses inward causing a super nova (an exploding stars). It is believed that supermassive black holes were made at the same time as their galaxy.

## How Do We Know There Are Black Holes If We Can't See Them?

Black holes are invisible to the naked eye -- light cannot escape because it is pulled into the middle of the black hole so humans cannot see black holes. However, we can use telescopes to find black holes by observing the behavior of stars and gas around a black hole. By imaging stars, scientists can determine if the stars' paths have been affected by the gravity of the black hole.

"When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light can not be seen with human eyes. Scientists use satellites and telescopes in space to see the high-energy light." -- [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html)
