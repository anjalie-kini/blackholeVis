# Black Hole Background

## Why Do We Care About Black Holes?

Recent developments in the field of astrophysics regarding gravitational wave detection of coalescing black holes has made it clear that black holes are not just theoretical objects of interest, but can in fact exist in the universe. Therefore, it is important to study how black holes operate and influence the astronomical bodies around them so that we can understand the consequences of such impacts.

## Light Paths Around a Black Holes

Although we cannot visualize a black hole, like scientists who look at star paths around a black hole, we can look at light paths around a black hole to better understand general relativity and curving.

In flat space time (assuming there are no non-gravitational forces in play) particles will travel in a straight line, but when space time is curved (as it is near a black hole, or any massive object), the paths become curved and particles lose energy to the gravitational field, which is called the gravitational redshift. The magnitude of this redshift is dependent on the mass, spin, and charge of the black hole. The motion and rotation of the blackhole can cause the light waves to be pushed closer together which makes the light bluer, which is known as a Doppler shift. The gravity near a black hole can completely change the direction of light, whose path can be completely warped. Using models to approximate light paths around a black hole is the only feasible method of study as observation with a telescope would be nearly impossible.

## This Visualization

In the accompanying visualization (created using MATLAB), a user can look at Kerr (rotating) or Schwarzschild (non-rotating) and vary the three parameters of a black hole (mass, spin, and charge). The purpose of this project is to aid in the understanding of black holes and general relativity.
